# Automotive Pairs Trading
Quantitative research of the Consumer Discretionary sector in the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges to find an optimal pair of automotive stocks for use in a pairs trading strategy.

# Goal
To employ a means-reversions strategy, whereby we expect reversions to the mean price. We find a cointegrated pair of assets in the automobile industry, using their spread as a financial instrument to be used in the trading strategy, employing the z-scores of the spread as an entry and exit threshold.

# Additional Research
Optimal holding period as a potential exit threshold via the Ornstein Uhlenbeck calculation of the spread's mean-reversion half-life.
Optimal leverage of the strategy.
